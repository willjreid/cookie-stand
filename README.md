# cookie-stand
Cookie Stand Project beginning 8/14/17

This project was created during my Code Fellows 201 course.  This project consists of a customer-facing website to promote the new venture, Pat's Salmon Cookies, and an internal page to track hourly cookie sales across five planned stores.  The internal page also allows you to add projections for additional stores and see them included in the daily sales projections via a dynamic form update.

#Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo into your local machine.  Run the index.html file to demo the customer site, and run the sales.html file to try the new store projection function.

#Prerequisites

You really just need a text editor and a browser.  And if you are using IE you should probably rethink your life decisions.

#Running the tests

At this time the system features a JS test coverage level of 0.  If developer skill increases and customer demand warrants, we can increase the test coverage up to the industry standard of 80%.


#Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

If you need to deploy the system, just get yourself a GitHub repo, copy the index.html file, sales.html file, app.js file and style.css file into your repo, then create a branch called gh-pages and you will be able to see the pages running in production.  While you're at it, buy something from the GH marketplace at https://github.com/marketplace to help support the site that is hosting your site for free.
